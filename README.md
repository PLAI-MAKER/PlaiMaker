# PlaiMaker

Basketball statistics and video sit in separate tools. Coaches, analysts, fans, and players move between spreadsheets, video editors, and web dashboards to connect numbers with film. This fragmentation wastes time and leads to missed insights.

Our product combines Hoopsalytics’ stat-by-video pipeline with an AI native, interactive layer. A user asks a question, receives an answer with supporting charts, and opens the exact clips in the click of a button.

The unified workspace cuts analysis time from hours to minutes. All stakeholders see the same data, clips, and annotations, which improves decision-making and engagement.
